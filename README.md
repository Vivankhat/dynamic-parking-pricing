# ðŸš— Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots  
**Summer Analytics 2025 Capstone Project**

This project implements a real-time, demand-driven dynamic pricing system for 14 urban parking lots using a live data stream. Built using Pathway and Bokeh, it allows real-time visualizations of three models responding to live occupancy and demand conditions.

## ðŸ“Š Models Implemented

### 1. **Model 1 â€“ Linear Occupancy-Based Pricing**
- `Price = Base + Î± * (Occupancy / Capacity)`
- Simple and reactive to current occupancy.

### 2. **Model 2 â€“ Demand-Based Pricing**
- Demand Score = weighted sum of:
  - Occupancy
  - Queue Length
  - Vehicle Type
  - Nearby Traffic
  - Special Events
- Maps to price range [10, 15] using a non-linear curve.

### 3. **Model 3 â€“ Competitive Pricing**
- For each lot, checks nearby competitors (within 0.5 km).
- Reduces price if another nearby lot is cheaper.
- Uses Haversine formula to compute lat-long distances.

---

## ðŸ§  Assumptions

- Occupancy data is streamed row by row.
- All inputs are normalized and bounded for pricing.
- Demand is calculated only for bike and car types.
- Competitors are only lots â‰¤ 0.5 km away.
